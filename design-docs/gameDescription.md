# AdventureGame Description:
This Adventure Game is a simple game that isn't really based off of any other game, but it almost acts as a simulation of what an adventure game could look like. There are 20 different locations/nodes that you can go to, and you want to get to The Grove in order to win the game. You will have to fight off goblins and monsters along the way. To get the most out of the game you should follow the path in order from nodes 1-20. The palyer will be able to grab a sword at any point during the game. If the player is able to grab a sword before encountering a monster than the player will be able to fight it off. If the player dies along the way than the game ends. But this game is more of a simulation and it is very hard for the player to lose.
