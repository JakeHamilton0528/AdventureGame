# Rules of AdventureGame:
- When code is ran a menu appears and gives you 4 different options (View the Game Map, Move to a new Node, Inspect and asset, and Exit the game).
- Viewing the game map allows you to look at what locations are at each node (Press 1 at the Enter your choice option).
- Moveing to a new node option allows your character to move to the node that you type (press 2 for this option. After typing 2 you can type in the number of the node you want to go to).
- You want to reach The Grove because that is where you will win, so it is best to enter each node in chronological order. (More of a simulation of an adventure game, than an actual game.)
- If you want to inspect an asset type in 3 under the enter your choice. This will allow your player to get a sword to fight off monsters.
- The monster(goblin) will pop up in one of the nodes so you have to be careful.
- Lastly to exit the game enter the number 4.
